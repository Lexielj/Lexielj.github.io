			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p> I'm a Research Assistant at <a href="http://ivg.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/">Intelligent Vision Group (IVG)</a>,  <b>Tsinghua University</b>, under the guidance of <a href="http://ivg.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/Jiwen_Lu/">Prof. Jiwen Lu</a>. I also worked at <b>SenseTime Research</b> as an intern now. In December 2020, I received B.S. degree in Computer Science and Mathematics at the University of Maryland. Before joined IVG, I did research at <a href="http://prg.cs.umd.edu/">Perception and Robotics Group (PRG)</a> in the <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/">Department of Computer Science</a>, <b>University of Maryland</b>, under the guidance of <a href="http://legacydirs.umiacs.umd.edu/~yiannis/">Prof. Yiannis Aloimonos</a>.
				My research interest is in <b>Computer Vision</b>, especially <b>Generative Models</b> and other interesting problems. I'll move to LA in January 2022 for Master degree.

							<p>We propose attention pyramid networks by the "split-attend-merge-stack" principle to jointly learn the attentions under different scales and obtain superior performance on many person re-identification datasets.

			<h1>Research Experience</h1>
			<h2>Current Project</h2>
			<h3>Diffusion Model for Generative Task</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Exploring the Diffusion Probabilistic Models.</li>

			</ul>

			<h3>Image Editting and Latent Space</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Exploring the latent space of GAN. Now researching on CLIP-based editing methods.</li>

			</ul>

			<h3>Music to Dance</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Generating 3D dance pose from input music.</li>

			</ul>




			<h2>Past Project</h2>
			<h3>3-D Reconstruction</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Researching on state-of-art 3D Reconstruction method, especially reconstruct with <a href="https://smpl.is.tue.mpg.de/">SMPL model</a>.</li>
				<li>Customized existing 3D construction methods to fit our dataset; maintained the human 3D reconstruction methods survey for the lab. </li>
			</ul>

<!-- 			<h3>Image-to-Image Translation</h3> -->
<!-- 			<ul> -->
<!-- 				<li>Completely replicated the result of the paper U-GAT-IT and AniGAN and implement the model to real-world products. Both methods have no open-sourced code in Pytorch and I implement them from scratch</li> -->
<!-- 				<li>Ongoing</li> -->
<!-- 			</ul> -->

			<h3>Person Re-identification</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Proposed a novel CNN-based network to re-identify person based on their movement style. </li>
				<li>Built an online and in-memory system to re-identify people with 85% accuracy under clean image setting.</li>
				<li>Propose to draw the counterfactual causality from the traditional trained "biased" network to infer the effect from bad bias, then remove them. Proposed a novel deep neural network for Person Re-ID task to make causal intervention in training and counterfactual reasoning in inference to remove the bad while keep the good features. </li>
				<li>Proposed an attention pyramid structure for Person Re-ID task to focus more on local attention of the feature map while keep the global attention of a human image. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin with -40% computational cost. The work has been submitted to TIP.</li>
			</ul>

<!-- 			<h3>Text-based Person Search</h3> -->
<!-- 			<ul> -->
<!-- 				<li>Proposed a novel CNN-based network for text-based person search, using Resnet50 and Bi-LSTM as backbone network</li> -->
